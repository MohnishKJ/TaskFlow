# TaskFlow – Because To-Do Lists Are Too Mainstream
Welcome to TaskFlow, the app that lets you log your tasks and track them in LeetCode-style tiles because checking off a boring list just isn’t satisfying enough. Built with Streamlit (because, of course), TaskFlow makes sure you have one more thing to procrastinate on before actually doing your tasks.

# What Does It Do?
You add tasks.
You track tasks.
You feel accomplished (without actually doing much).
It looks cool, which is what really matters.

# How to Use?
Open it.
Add a task.
Stare at it for a while.
Move it across tiles when you finally do something.

# Why TaskFlow?
Because regular to-do lists are too judgmental, and this one at least makes you feel like you're solving a coding problem instead of just postponing work.

# Will It Change Your Life?
Absolutely, But it might make tracking your unfinished work slightly less soul-crushing.
